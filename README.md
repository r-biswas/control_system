## Fall Detection & Alert - Android Application using Fuzzy Logic in MATLAB Simulink with GitHub link

Designed and deployed a Fuzzy logic based Android App, which does the followingâ€¦

1. Monitor the accelerometer data of your phone when the App ON and detect if there is a fall.
2. If there is a fall, automatically switch ON the microphone of the phone and measure the sound level.
3. Using the fuzzy sound levels (Low, Medium, High), and fuzzy accelerometer levels (Low, Medium, High), estimate the level of danger (Low, Medium, High).
4. If the level of danger is High, send an alert to another phone (using TCP/IP or UDP network), transmitting the the GPS location of the first phone. 
5. Play a buzzer sound (alarm type) in the first phone, if the danger levels are Medium or High, with the sound level of the buzzer sound proportional to the danger level
6. Play buzzer in parents app too.
